# SAP Retail Management System

The **SAP Retail Management System** utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to streamline the operations of a supermarket. This project focuses on automating inventory management, profit calculation, staff management, and promotions in **S.A.P Super**, a supermarket located in Bihalpola Kurunegala.

## Key Features

### Inventory Management
The system provides an efficient inventory management solution, ensuring that items are restocked automatically when running low. It allows the supermarket owner to track the movement of stock and monitor misplaced or missing items, preventing revenue loss.

### Financial Insights
The system calculates both **gross** and **net profit** on a daily basis, offering insights into the supermarket's financial performance. This helps the owner to assess profitability and make data-driven decisions.

### Staff Management
A comprehensive staff management subsystem allows the owner to monitor staff performance, manage salaries, and update staff information, ensuring that staff operations run smoothly.

### Customer Loyalty and Promotions
Customers are rewarded with promotions based on their loyalty. The system allows the scheduling of promotions and provides features to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.

### Complaint Tracking
The system enables tracking of both **customer and staff complaints**. The owner can view complaints categorized by date and type, ensuring that all issues are addressed effectively and that operations are optimized based on feedback.
